# FUSOTAO

FUSOTAO|ふそうタオ|扶桑道


[FUSOTAO](https://fusotao.org) is a permissionless blockchain aims to make the digital assets circulate trustlessly. 
We are not intend to make the exchange decentralized, instead, we build FUSOTAO as infrastructures to help the centralized exchange trustlessly. If you are interested in building a crypto currency exchange service, refer to the [Galois](https://github.com/uinb/galois) project, which is a high performance matching engine written in rust.

FUSOTAO is based on [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) and still under development. Here we salute to the substrate dev team! Thanks for the awesome works.
